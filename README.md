<p align="center">Explore the information, name, capital, and flag of each country with just a click on a world map! Currently under development.</p>

## Background

I'm not very good at remembering countries' names and their positions, and I haven't had a chance to work on mapping components in frontend yet. That's why I came up with a small project working with mapping components that can help people who has the same issue like me memorize countries better!

## Built With

- Next.js 14 - Development environment
- Tailwind CSS - CSS framework
- Next UI - Components library for User Interface
